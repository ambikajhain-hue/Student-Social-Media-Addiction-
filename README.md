# Student-Social-Media-Addiction-
This study examined the digital behaviors of 705 students (roughly equal split between males and females) between the ages of 18 and 24 to see how social media impacts their daily lives.
Time Spent Online: On average, students are spending nearly 5 hours a day on social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook. In some cases, this screen time reached as high as 8.5 hours.
The Sleep & Study Trade-off: There is a clear link between heavy usage and late-night scrolling. Average sleep time sits around 6.8 hours, but as screen time goes up.
Mental Health Impact: The research found that students spending more than 6 hours daily on social media reported the lowest mental health scores. This group frequently experienced higher stress levels and more personal conflicts.
